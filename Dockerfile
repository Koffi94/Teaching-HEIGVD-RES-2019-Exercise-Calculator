# When we build the image, we copy the executable jar in the image file system.

COPY calulatorClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /opt/app/client.jar

# Our application will accept TCP connections on port 2205. Note that the EXPOSE statement
# does not make the container accessible via the host. For the container to really be accessible,
# we must either use the -p or the -P flag when using the docker run command. With -p, we can
# specify an explicit port mapping (and EXPOSE is not even required). With -P, we let Docker 
# assign random ports for each EXPOSEd port. We can then use the docker port command to know the port
# numbers that have been selected.
#
#EXPOSE 2205

#
# This is the command that is executed when the Docker container starts

CMD ["java", "-jar", "/opt/app/client.jar"]
